# MyReads Project

Install and Launch Instructions :

## Description

-In This Project We Are Creating An App To Track Our Books And Organize Them In Sections "shelves" Starting With Currently Reading Books Then Want To Read And Finally Finished Books

## How It Works

- Break Down The Starter Code For Multiple Components.
- Use React useEffect To Fetch Data From API.
- Each Component Fetching And Rendering Data Dynamically.
- Home Component Renders Three Shelves With Books Assigned To Each Shelf According To Use Choice From The Drop Down Menu.
- Ability To Search From The Search Page And Add Books To ANy Shelf Desired.
- Added Search Page To Look Up Books And Add Them To Any Of The Choosen Shelves.
- If A Book Already On The Shelves It Won't Get Added Twice.
- Everything Happens Is Stored To Local Storage Through The Api So When User Refresh Or Close The App Stored Data Will Stay There For Future Visits.
